In this project I used Bureau of Transportation Statistics on flight cancellation data for domestic flights

In addition, I used data on airports and carriers. 

The main findings of the analysis are:

- before the tragic 9/11 event happened there was a continuous trend in the increased number of flights that are cancelled in the period 1996 - 2001

- 2007 was the year with the highest number of all domestic flights

- the number of flights is distributed almost evenly throughout the year

- the months with the highest relative flight cancellations are December, January, February, and September

- the lowest are April, May, and November

- Hawaiian Airlines and Frontier Airlines have the least percentage of cancelled flights

- the highest number of cancellations are in Ameriacan Eagle and Comair airlines

- eastern states tend to have higher number of cancelled flights (with New York and Massatusetts being the highest)
 
- the highest number of cancellated flights in 30 years happened in September 2001 (with 21% of all domestic flights being cancelled)

- we can see that in 2003 the number of airlines almost doubled due to new companies entering the market

- also, from one of the heatmaps, we can clearly observe all the merges that happened between airlines
 
- from multivariate analysis, we can conclude that the season pattern for each airline is the same across 30 years
